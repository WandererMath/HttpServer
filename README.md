# HttpServer

Building a simple http/https server by higher level languages (here node.js) which implement protocols in layer 4 of TCP/IP Model.

Handling http requests GET/POST. Illustrates page rendering by javascript. Later I may add some javascripts fetching data from REST API to illustrate AJAX. 

Illustrates usage of TLS certificate. Note: this is a self-signed certificate for illustration purpose. Get a certificate from reputed CA for commercial usage. 

Node.js interpreter required. To run:  node server3.js
